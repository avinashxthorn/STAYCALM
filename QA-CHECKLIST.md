# Bloom 3.0 validation

## Automated gates

- JVM: evolution boundaries, timer drift, pause clamping, reboot fallback, wall-clock changes, display rounding, streak duplicates/gaps/year boundaries.
- Android lint and debug APK assembly.
- Android 15 emulator: launch, pink screen screenshots, planner add/start, focus pause/resume/end, persisted timer after Activity recreation, break mode, atomic/idempotent completion, no focus credit for breaks.

Reports and screenshots are uploaded by the main build workflow. A workflow is only verified when its run completes successfully.

## Device checks still useful

- Test large font settings, screen rotation, TalkBack, and reduced animation settings on the user's handset.
- Allow notifications, deny notifications, and toggle precise-alarm access. Validate background completion under the handset's battery-saving modes.
- Check DND restoration, interrupted playback, wired/Bluetooth audio, and the sound notification stop action.
- Test reminder delivery after restart and editing a future reminder into the past.
- Listen for acceptable soundscape loop boundaries.

No finite set of checks can guarantee an app has no defects on every Android device.
